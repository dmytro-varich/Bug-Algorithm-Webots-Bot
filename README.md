## üîÅ Algorithm
![Bug 2 Scheme](https://github.com/dmytro-varich/Bug-Algorithm-Webots-Bot/blob/main/assets/Bug_2_Scheme.png)

The **Bug2 algorithm** is a classical path-planning algorithm for mobile robots navigating in environments with unknown obstacles. It combines **goal-oriented motion** with **obstacle following**, making it both simple and effective for many robotic applications. Bug2 allows a robot to move towards a goal in a straight line (called the **M-line**) until it encounters an obstacle. When that happens, the robot follows the obstacle‚Äôs boundary until it can **rejoin the M-line** and continue toward the goal.

## ü§ñ Robot Model

</p>

The robot model in Webots represents a mobile platform with a differential drive and a set of sensors for navigation and spatial orientation. The robot is equipped with various sensors, including **lidars**, a **compass**, **GPS**, and **ultrasonic sensors (sonars)**, enabling obstacle detection and environmental awareness. Each wheel is controlled by a **motor** and tracked with a **position encoder** to enable precise motion control. Both the wheels and the robot body have `boundingObjects` defined via `Shape` (Cylinder). A simplified physical behavior is specified (**mass**, **density**) suitable for motion simulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation
![Bug 2 Algorithm](https://github.com/dmytro-varich/Bug-Algorithm-Webots-Bot/blob/main/assets/Bug2_Algorithm.drawio.png)

The algorithm is implemented in **Python** using the **Webots** simulation environment with a custom robot model. The navigation logic is based on two main states: `go_to_goal` (moving towards the target) and `follow_wall` (obstacle avoidance). The robot relies on **GPS**, **compass**, **lidar**, and **ultrasonic sensors** to perceive its environment and make decisions.

At the start, the robot determines its initial position and begins moving in a straight line towards the goal (the so-called **M-line**). If it encounters an obstacle, it switches to the `follow_wall` state, where it follows the boundary of the obstacle. The robot records the **hit point** (where it first touches the obstacle) and searches for a **leave point** on the M-line that is closer to the goal.

While following the wall, the robot transitions between substates:

* `turn_right` ‚Äî turning right when an obstacle is directly in front.
* `turn_left` ‚Äî turning left if the wall is lost on the left side.
* `move_forward` ‚Äî moving forward along the wall.
* `search_wall` ‚Äî searching for the wall after a turn.

When the robot returns to the M-line and is closer to the goal than it was at the hit point, it switches back to `go_to_goal` and continues moving towards the target. The implementation also includes a safeguard against infinite loops: if the robot returns to the hit point on the M-line and the goal is still unreachable, it stops and concludes that the goal cannot be reached.
